		Our rules are really <i>really simple</i>, if you take the time to learn them. And you <i>should!</i>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Don't be an asshole.</b> If you don't have something constructive to say, <i>don't say it!</i> This is the big one.
			<li><b>This forum's official language is English</b>. Don't use chat-speak or other unfunny gimmicks.
			<li><b>Double-posting / bumping old threads.</b> Replying within minutes asking if anybody has read your post is a terrible idea. Double posting after a day or two <i>with something new or updated</i> is fine, though. If you want to bump an old thread, contribute something new to it.
			<li><b>Don't get in fights.</b> If you're having trouble with another user, contact an administrator.
			<li><b>Nothing illegal.</b> No warez, illegal crap, etc. There are exceptions for ROMs in certain cases.
			<li><b>The staff has the final say in everything.</b> We can ban you for any reason or no reason at all. Posting here is NOT a right.
		</ol>
		<br>Punishments are given on a case-by-case basis, from 'warning' to 'permanent ban'.
		<br>
		<br>We are a relaxed community, but constantly breaking the rules will get you banned fast.
		<br>
		<br>If you have any questions, feel free to ask <a href='memberlist.php?pow=3'>one of the admins</a> for help.

		Always, by reading the rules... but since you're here, it's <i>probably</i> a safe bet that you've already done that. (If you haven't, <i>now is a great time.</i>)
		<br>
		<br>Once you've done that, <a href='register.php'>sign up for an account</a> (or <a href='login.php'>log in</a> if you've already made one). It's simple and very easy to do. After you're registered, you're more than welcome to just <a href='forum.php?id=1'>jump in and say hi</a> by posting in the Introductions thread, or even making your own. We're friendly people and won't bite (usually). Let us know about yourself, how you found us, or whatever's on your mind &mdash; or just jump in and start contributing to discussions.

		The n00b sticker is our way of telling you that your post was pretty awful. Usually it's for one of the following reasons:
		<ol>
			<li>Complete disregard for our rules. If you show that you really can't even be bothered to read the small number of rules we have here, you're going to wear your welcome out <em>very</em> fast.</li>
			<li>Flagrant lack of basic knowledge. For example, if there's a sticky saying 'don't make a new thread for this' and you make a new thread for it, that's a big sign that you don't read the rules.</li>
			<li>Using dumb memes or bandwagoning. Everybody loves a laugh every now and then. Nobody loves it being rammed down their throat every five seconds.</li>
			<li>Terrible spelling or grammar. This is beyond the occasional misspelling (even the best of us make mistakes), but if you make a post loaded with \"Your a looser\", well...</li>
			<li>Your post is just mind-bogglingly terrible or groan-worthy.</li>
		</ol>
		The n00b sticker is something of a mark of shame. Usually it's an early warning indicator before we start taking issues with your actions on a broader scale, so if you see them, you should probably shape up. Note, however, that they can just as similarly be used as a joke.
		<br>
		<br><strong>Remember:</strong> The fastest way to get yourself stamped is to make a big deal out of it.

	Post layouts are like signatures on other forums, but on steroids. Rather than just some text, an image, and maybe a link, post layouts allow you to style your <em>entire post</em>! You too can turn your wonderful contributions into a GeoCities&trade;-esque abomination.
	<br>
	<br>You can enable or disable the showing of post layouts by choosing the relevant option in your <a href='editprofile.php'>profile settings</a>.
	<br>
	<br>(Particularly egregious/unreadable layouts will be removed by admins. Abuse of this feature will lead to you no longer being able to use one.)
	<br>
	<br>You can customize your layout with fun facts about your statistics by using &amp;tags&amp;, outlined below.
